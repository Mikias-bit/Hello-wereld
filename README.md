# Hello-wereld
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow. My Name is Mikias and I have taken courses in data engineering and machine learning. My back ground of study was physics and scientific computing. At the moment I have my own business and taking a course on digital marketing. I want to grow my business with the skills that I have acquired all these years.
